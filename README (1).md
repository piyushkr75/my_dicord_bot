# Discord Gemini AI Bot

This is a Discord bot built using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and [Google Generative AI](https://ai.google.dev/) (Gemini API). The bot allows users to ask questions via Discord and get responses generated by Google's Gemini model. It also features a `/create` slash command as a starter for future short URL functionalities.

---

## Features

- **Ask Gemini AI:** Use `!ask <your question>` in any Discord channel to get an AI-generated answer.
- **Slash Commands:** Includes `/create` command placeholder for future short URL creation.
- **Environment-based configuration:** Uses `.env` file for sensitive data (Discord token, Gemini API key).
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles missing environment variables and Gemini API errors.
